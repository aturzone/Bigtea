# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the major version is `0`, anything may change in a minor release.

## [Unreleased]

Planned, in the order the measurements justify — see
[`docs/graph/backlog/lts-0-0-0.md`](docs/graph/backlog/lts-0-0-0.md):

- KV cache for the DeepSeek-V4-Flash path. Worth ~3-4x, and on **disk traffic**
  rather than attention: a 5-token pass touches ~26 expert slices per layer where
  a cached single-token pass would touch 6.
- Profile `layer_tail` + `moe_routing`, which is 21% of a forward pass for a
  handful of small operations and has never been examined.
- Model downloader (`bigtea pull`) resolving names to Hugging Face repos, with
  resume, checksums and a disk-space check before starting.
- Quant selection from the hardware probe, with the tok/s prediction stated
  *before* a 144 GB download begins.
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` server.
- Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows.

## [0.0.0] — 2026-08-07

First public release. The engine works and is verified; the product around it is
not built yet. See [README](README.md#status) for what is and is not there.

### Added

- **Runs Mixture-of-Experts models several times larger than RAM, on CPU.**
  Always-read weights stay resident; routed experts stream from disk as routing
  selects them.
- **DeepSeek-V4-Flash (`deepseek4`) support** — 43 blocks, hyper-connections,
  three kinds of compressed attention (raw, compressed-sparse, heavily
  compressed), hash routing on the first three layers and biased top-k routing on
  the other 40. Verified element-by-element against llama.cpp on all 43 blocks
  plus the output head.
- **Qwen3 and Qwen3-MoE support**, with a frequency-gated expert cache.
- **Cache-bypassing direct I/O** (`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING` / `O_DIRECT`), falling
  back to buffered reads and *reporting* that it did rather than pretending.
- **Zero-copy expert reads.** `SkewedBuf` deliberately misaligns the destination
  buffer to match the file's sector residue, because GGUF pads tensor data to 32
  bytes rather than to a disk sector — so a conventionally aligned buffer can
  never receive a direct transfer. 0.80 → 1.58 GiB/s, with 0.09% of bytes copied
  instead of 300%.
- **Residency with a hard budget**, which reports what did not fit, what
  re-reading it costs per token, and which processes to close to fix it.
- `bigtea-run` — prefill and generation.
- `bigtea-probe` — RAM, disk, GPU, and what to close.
- `bigtea-model-info` — fit prediction and tok/s estimate before running.
- `bigtea-meta`, `gguf-info`, `bigtea-loadbench` — container and I/O inspection.
- 157 unit tests and 16 container-backed tests.

### Performance

Measured on one machine (15.7 GiB RAM, NVMe at 2.55 GB/s, 20 threads). Both
engines produce identical, correct output; llama.cpp is measured with a warm page
cache. Full command lines and outputs in
[`head-to-head-llamacpp-2026-08-05.md`](docs/graph/research/head-to-head-llamacpp-2026-08-05.md).

Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M prefill, Bigtea / llama.cpp:

| tokens | Bigtea | llama.cpp |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 565 | **27.64** | 23.55 |
| 2206 | **36.60** | 33.59 |
| 4395 | 38.40 | 40.25 |
| 8775 | 34.88 | 35.01 |
| 4395 (`-b 4096`) | **43.61** | 40.25 |

### Known limitations

- **Generation is slower than llama.cpp.** DeepSeek-V4-Flash: 0.077 tok/s against
  0.45, because the V4-Flash path has no KV cache yet and each token re-runs the
  whole sequence. Qwen3-30B-A3B: 1.07 against 2.16, about 2x. Bigtea *is* ahead
  on V4-Flash prefill (0.49 vs 0.41) and load (4.1s vs 12.3s). No claim beyond
  that is made anywhere in this repository.
- **Linux and macOS build and pass the unit tests in CI, but no model has been
  run on either.** macOS additionally has no direct-I/O path — `F_NOCACHE` needs
  an `fcntl` after opening and is not written yet — so it falls back to buffered
  reads and the page-cache problems this design exists to avoid.
- No model downloader; bring your own `.gguf`.
- No server or API.
- No prebuilt binaries; ggml must be built first and `GGML_LIB_DIR` set.
- Only `qwen3`, `qwen3moe` and `deepseek4` architectures run. Others parse as
  containers but will not execute.

### Retracted

- **"llama.cpp cannot run models larger than RAM."** It can, with `--no-repack`.
  This claim survived several days on a misattributed error string because nobody
  ran the opposing command. It is retracted in writing, and the project now
  requires a competitor's exact command line and output before any competitive
  claim is citable.
